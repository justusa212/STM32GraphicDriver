Hey there :) The driver we wrote in the video is found under the "Extra" folder, everything else is mostly CubeMX generated.
If you JUST WANT the driver/graphics library, get it from the Extra folder and dump the rest.

I didn't include the whole code generated by CubeMX since the folder would be 94MB, as it is this is NOT COMPILABLE and you'll have to use CubeMX to re-gen the code by opening "BABYDRIVER.ioc"
You probably won't be using the Nucleo platform I showed in the video, so this extra stuff is there just as an example - mod it to your hearts content!

Have a good one,
hoff
